### Why does your org want to participate in google summer of code?

First, we would like to increase the diversity of the Racket
community.  Second, we want to encourage new members to become long
term contributors.

We believe the Google Summer of Code program will help us achieve
these goals.  The program would let us recruit students who come from
a different background than our current contributors.  It will also
enable us to recruit new students who we would not otherwise be able
to financially support.

### How will you keep mentors engaged with their students

Our org admins will check up on mentors weekly to ensure that they are
communicating with their students. We will encourage all mentors to
teleconference with their students at least once a week. In case a
mentor has to leave the program, we will recruit several backup mentors.

### How will you help students stay on schedule

As mentioned in other answers, we will require weekly blog posts and
mentor check ups.  The blog posts will contain the student's progress,
milestones, and goals for the next week.  This enables mentors to keep
track of their student's progress and help them set reasonable goals.

### How will you get students involved in your community during GSoC.

We will require students to participate on the IRC channel and the
mailing list. Students will be encouraged to publish
weekly blog posts documenting their progress.

To help students make connections in the community, we will encourage
mentors to introduce their mentees to the core development team.
Additionally, we will have students introduce themselves and announce
their projects on the mailing list.

Finally, on the technical side, Racket has many tutorials and abundant
documentation to help students get started. Also, we will prepare
short warm up exercises to help students get up-to-speed.

### How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC

We will provide talk slots at RacketCon (our annual user conference in
September) for all students who complete their projects.
For students who need travel support to RacketCon, we plan to cover
their travel costs through the organization's portion of the stipend.

### Short Description

Racket is a general-purpose programming language that provides a
platform for DSL design, implementation, and tooling.

### Long description

Racket is a general-purpose programming language inspired by lisp. It
provides a platform for designing and building languages, especially
domain specific languages (DSLs). Some examples of languages hosted in Racked
include Typed Racket (a statically typed dialect), Nanopass (a DSL for
creating compilers), and Scribble (a documentation DSL).

Additionally, Racket provides an environment that is easy for students
to get involved in. DrRacket, Racket's built in IDE, smoothly
transitions from student to expert programmer. Many educators are part
of the Racket community, and are happy to help new members.

The proposed projects for Racket range from building new libraries,
tools, and languages, to hacking on the VM and compiler for Racket.
