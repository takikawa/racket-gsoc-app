### Why does your org want to participate in google summer of code?

First, we would like to increase the diversity of the Racket community.
Second, we want to encourage new members to become long term contributors.

We believe the Google Summer of Code program will help us achieve these goals.
The program would let us recruit students who come from a different background than our current contributors.
It will also enable us to recruit new students who we would not otherwise be able to financially support.
