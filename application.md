Racket Programming Language

### Organization description ###

Racket is both a general-purpose programming language and a platform
for building and extending languages. Racket combines functional,
object-oriented, and other styles of programming together with powerful
metaprogramming that goes beyond macros.

Racket and its IDE, DrRacket, are used around the world to teach
introductory computer science along with the How to Design Programs
textbook[1]. On the flip side, Racket is used to develop real-world
applications in areas like web programming, game development,
and scientific computing.

The project has a long history of accepting external contributions.
The PLaneT package repository[2] contains many open-source libraries
contributed by Racket developers and community members. The development
team is large with around 30 core developers and around 60 committers.

### Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code 2012? What do you hope to gain by participating? ###

Racket provides a broad set of tools out of the box, but its weakness is that it has fewer
libraries compared to competing languages like Haskell and Python. Furthermore, Racket has
less mindshare among programmers who weren't taught in a CS program that uses it. Through
Summer of Code, we aim to develop more libraries to make Racket more practical and increase
its mindshare among students who want to work on open-source software.

### Did your organization participate in past Google Summer of Codes? If so, please summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your participation. ###

N/A

### If your organization has not previously participated in Google Summer of Code, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)? ###

Yes, 2006.

### Does your organization have an application template you would like to see students use? If so, please provide it now. ###

Yes https://github.com/plt/racket/wiki/SoC-Student-Application
 
### What criteria did you use to select your mentors for this year's program? Please be as specific as possible. ###

We plan to choose mentors from among developers from the community
who volunteer to mentor for specific projects. For each project, we
will have at least one backup mentor from the core development team
in case there are any mentoring issues. We will make sure that
all projects have a mentor who is a known and experienced Racket
programmer.

### What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? ###

We plan to require a weekly report from each participating student.
The weekly reports will take a written form and will be accompanied by
either a text or voice conversation between the student and his/her
mentor. Students who fail to meet these requirements will fail the
midterm and/or final evaluation.

### What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? ###

Racket has a large development team (around 30), so we plan to have several
mentors who can serve as backup in case of disappearances.
The admin and backup admin can serve as mentors if necessary.

### What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program? ###

Our plan is to encourage students to start familiarizing themselves with
the Racket framework right away and participate on the IRC channel (#racket)
and the mailing list. We will prioritize students who participate in the
community during the applications period when choosing students.

Since Racket has a large amount of teaching material bundled with it (e.g.,
textbooks and tutorials), it should be easy to get students up-to-speed
compared to other projects.
