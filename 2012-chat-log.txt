<carols> hi racket folks
<racket|asumu> Hello
<racket|samth> hi carols
<carols> so the ideas page is certainly lengthy enough for your org, but i would have liked to see more "meat" for each of the ideas.
 so quantity is fine, but quality could use a little improvement.
<racket|asumu> I see, so more technical details?
<racket|samth> carols: or organizational details?
<carols> technical details
 i think organizational details are fine here.
<racket|asumu> Okay, thanks. Did the application form itself have enough details?
<carols> yeah, i think so. since you have participated in the past we trust that you can handle disappearing students and mentors, which you seemed to address in the app.
<racket|samth> carols: we haven't actually participated in the past
<carols> oh? it says you did in 2006.
 i wasn't here, so i don't know for sure.
<racket|samth> carols: we applied but were rejected in 2006
<carols> oh, i see.
 well, regardless.
 the ideas page was a B+ and we were making cuts to A+ ideas pages for orgs this year.
<racket|samth> do you have any examples of organizations with A+ ideas pages that you recommend we look at?
<carols> sure, just a sec.
 http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2011/Ideas
 that's one.
 we list that one in the FAQs.
<racket|samth> ok, thanks
<carols> or you can look at the ideas pages for any of the orgs that were accepted this year.
<racket|samth> any other feedback?
<carols> please try again next year?
<racket|samth> ok
<carols> we did really like your app, it was just another tough call.
<racket|asumu> Okay, thanks. We'll apply again next year. :)
<racket|samth> it would have been very helpful for us to know about this feedback session in the rejection email
<carols> thank you :-0
 :-)
<racket|samth> i only learned about it from reading blog posts by other rejected orgs
<carols> yep, something for us to improve for next year
 there's always something we can be doing better.
<carols> have a great summer!
